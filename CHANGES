RegAligner is back on track! Because Google tried to help Mikhail Gorbachev!

There have been plenty of changes, and I will publish stuff that would give a paper. You won't get all I did, though.

*********
As of November 28 2013, RegAligner is DISCONTINUED.
The main author has permanently left academic research. He may react to e-mails

NOTE: since version 1.3 RegAligner uses C++-11. The amount of non-C++-03 code will increase.


RegAligner Change History

*** after the last release ***
- IBM-3 can now take target word classes
- HMM can now get a redpar limit. Default is 5, as before
- IBM-2 now estimates p0, and it uses source word classes
- IBM-1 got an alternative model IBM1p0 with fixed p0

*** release version 1.3 (released February 14 2020, lacking a Valentine) ***
- several new model variants
- made IBM-2 competitive and bug-free, with parametric models (but so far p0 is fixed to 0.02) and regularity terms
- implemented fertility pooling via fertility classes
- HMM now available with classes and with start empty word
- implemented most combinations
- IBM-3 Viterbi alignment computation via ILP is now fully working and significantly faster
- fertility based models can now also fix the zero prob. to 0
- constraint mode for IBM-3 is now working (without NULL and in Viterbi mode) and ITG got 4 extension levels
- bugfixes, in particular for Viterbi-ICM and gradient descent
- numerous speed-ups, in particular for hillclimbing
- more compact implementation of m-steps
- increased the maximal number of hillclimbing iterations
- improved dictionary and alignment/distortion m-steps, some iteration limits can now be set on command line

*** release version 1.21 (released September 1 2013) ***
- IBM-5 now depends on the IBM-4 intra word class mode and has a nontrivial start probability
- fixed two bugs for writing posterior alignments to file 
- some internal restructuring to streamline the code 

*** release version 1.2 (released May 18 2013) ***
- implemented count collection from HMM
- added nondeficient mode for IBM-3/4 (as in [Schoenemann, ACL 2013])
- added IBM-5
- refined handling of counts too close to 0
- made some alternative word class modes available on command line
- added alternative projection routine with better worst case complexity (no speed-ups in practice)
- major bugfix for IBM-3/4 regarding p0 count collection (for EM)
- some minor fixes and refinements, including speed-up of ICM by using log
  lookup tables and grouping of common code patterns, plus when converting general
  alignments to satisfy the fertility constraints of IBM-3/4/5
- now running IBM-3 and IBM-4 by default, plus reducing deficiency is no longer the default

*** release version 1.05 (released March 6 2013) ***
- two bugfixes for IBM-4
- major correction for word classes: now actually implementing the dependence of [Brown et al. 93]
- streamlining of the source code for IBM-3 and IBM-4

*** release version 1.02 (released on December 29 2012) ***
- improved Makefile (more compatible now)
- small fix for IBM-4 dev alignment computation
- restructured and added option -max-lookup <uint> to save memory (at the cost of run time)
- revised initialization of p0 for IBM-3/4 from HMM
- revised strategy for word classes in IBM-4 regarding run-time and memory

*** release version 1.0 (released on December 09 2012) ***
- parameterization of HMM now selectable on command line, plus added some variants
- added options to the IBM-3: 
  probability for empty word can now be fixed on command line, the original empty word of Brown et al. can be used
  and nonparametric distortion models can be used
- added options to the IBM-4:
  + (like in the IBM-3) probability for empty word can now be fixed and the original empty word of Brown et al. can be used
  + option to use a more deficient variant (according to Brown et al.)
- IBM-4 now implements word classes
- speed-up for Viterbi computation of HMM with reduced parameterization
- HMM Viterbi prob is now returned as a long double
- bugfix in count collection for IBM-4
- bugfix in m-step for parametric distortion in IBM-3, plus now using non-trivial initialization
- small bugfixes for HMM, plus extended Viterbi-mode
- improved some numerical issues
- added option -dont-print-energy to speed up computations (while reducing output information)

*** release version 0.92 (released on May 08 2012) ***
- can now specify a fertility limit for IBM-3/4
- improved speed of hillclimbing in IBM-4
- made ICM a little more extensive
- speed-ups for ICM in IBM-4

**** release version 0.9 ***
- first released version, May 02 2012
