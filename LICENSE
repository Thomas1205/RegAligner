This software (except for the C++-Toolbox) was exclusively written by 

Thomas Schoenemann.

The code was written in roughly equal parts in his freetime, at Lund
University, Sweden and at the University of Düsseldorf, Germany. A few
contributions were added at the University of Pisa, Italy. and at the
University of Düsseldorf, Germany. The package includes a recent (partial)
version of the C++-Toolbox by Thomas Schoenemann, which received additional
support from Petter Strandmark and Miriam Käshammer.

5. Citing papers by the author
If you use this software for publications, please consider if citing one
(or more) of the following papers is appropriate:

- [T. Schoenemann, Probabilistic Word Alignment Under the L_0-norm, CoNLL 2011.]
(relevant in combination with Viterbi-training)

- [T. Schoenemann, Regularizing Mono- and Bi-word Models for Word Alignment, IJCNLP 2011.]
(relevant when using gradient descent or EM with regularity terms, 
or when emphasis on the corrected HMM training is appropriate)

- [T. Schoenemann, Training Nondeficient Variants of IBM-3 and IBM-4 for Word
  Alignment, ACL 2013] (when you use nondeficient training of IBM-3 and IBM-4)

- [T. Schoenemann, Computing Optimal Alignments for the IBM-3 Translation Model,
CoNLL 2010]

6. Citing papers not by the author
If you use this software for publications, please consider if citing one
(or more) of the following papers is appropriate:

- if you use L_0 in combination with EM:
[A. Vaswani and L. Huang and D. Chiang, Smaller Alignment Models for Better
Translations: Unsupervised Word Alignment with the L0-norm. ACL 2012.]

- if you use the HMM with classes:
[K. Toutanova, H.T. Ilhan and C. Manning, Extensions to HMM-based Statistical
Word Alignment Models, EMNLP 2002]

- you probably want to cite the seminal paper
[P.F. Brown and S.A. Della Pietra and V.J. Della Pietra and R.L. Mercer,
 The mathematics of statistical machine translation: Parameter estimation,
 Computational Linguistics, 19(2), pp 263-311 1993]

- for the HMM,
[S. Vogel, H. Ney and C. Tillman, HMM-based word alignment in statistical
translation, COLING 1996] 

- for deficient empty words and evaluation issues:
[F.J. Och and H. Ney, A systematic comparison of various statistical alignment
modes, Computational Linguistics, 29(1), pp 19-51, 2003]
